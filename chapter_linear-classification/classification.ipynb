        "Classification is a sufficiently common problem that it warrants its own convenience functions. Of central importance in classification is the *accuracy* of the classifier. Note that while we often care primarily about accuracy, we train classifiers to optimize a variety of other objectives for statistical and computational reasons. However, regardless of which loss function was minimized during training, it is useful to have a convenience method for assessing the accuracy of our classifier empirically.\n",

Lastly, denote by $l_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{b}$ the loss on the last minibatch. Express $L_\\textrm{v}$ in terms of $L_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{q}$, $l_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{b}$, and the sample and minibatch sizes.\n",
